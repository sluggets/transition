        <h3>Stage 1: Cell Phones, Cell Phones, Cell Phones and Other
            Traditional Distractions</h3>
        <p>
           The goal with distractions <em>must</em> always be to not
           make excuses for allowing them into the driver's seat. It
           would be a very unusually disciplined driver that didn't 
           have room for improvement here. If we honestly apply three
           standards to potential behaviors, we will have our answer 
           as to whether or not it is a distraction.
           <ul class="dist_list">
               <li><strong>Visual</strong><span class="dist"><i class="fa fa-eye fa-2x"></i></span></li>
               <li><strong>Manual</strong><span class="dist"><i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o fa-2x"></i></span></li>
               <li><strong>Cognitive</strong><span class="dist"><i class="fa fa-cogs fa-2x"></i></span></li>
           </ul>
           Cell phones obviously are the primary culprit here, and 
           usually will be all three types of distraction. Behaviors
           need not be all three to be dangerous distractions however.
           Any one in and of itself can be unsafe. An LED state highway
           sign warning you not to use your cell phone while driving
           could be a visual distraction and steal focus. If the 
           temptation is too strong, put the cell phone somewhere you
           cannot reach it easily, such as the glove box, or throw it
           in the back seat!

        <h3>Stage 2: Increased Complexity Does Not Necessarily Mean Increased Safety</h3>
        <p>
           The road to completely autonomous vehicles will be paved with
           more complicated and densely packed instrumentation, lights,
           and dash buttons. Feature creep presents a problem to be 
           solved. How successfully will the human driver monitor or keep 
           track of new technologies? Whether it is nested menus on an 
           LCD screen, 
           vibrating steering wheels, added warning indicators, or clustered
           button and dial controls that require repeated scrutiny to 
           operate, the driver's eyes will be increasingly drawn away from
           more important matters.
        </p>
        <p>
           Even if not guilty of such offenses, most of us have seen the
           consequences of distracted driving. Vehicles have been 
           rear-ended, sideswiped, or otherwise endangered by oblivious
           drivers engaged in distracted driving. Assisted driver systems
           such as FCW(Forward Collision Warning), ACC(Adaptive Cruise
           Control), and LDW(Lane Departure Warning) while being safety
           features may enable bad behaviors. A driver who
           regularly endulges in distracting behaviors, may be unduly
           reassured by these safety mechanisms. In the event
           of their catastrophic failure or the driver simply being
           in a different vehicle without these features, the overall
           safety may be worse than if these technologies were never
           even introduced to the driver. 
        </p>
        <p>
           In the intermediary stages, vehicles billed as "autonomous
           vehicles" may not truly be autonomous. However gracefully the 
           vehicle may fail in it's autonomous duties, this
           intermediary AV will still require the human driver to 
           suddenly assume control in a matter of seconds in certain
           special-case scenarios. Sitting in
           the driver's seat of an AV, distracting activites will be 
           irresistable. This will certainly complicate the handover from 
           AV to human. 
        </p>
        <h3>Stage 3: Oblivious Safety</h3>
        <p>
           In the AV utopia, all of the various assisted driver
           technologies will no longer have to be monitored by the
           human passenger. The AV and it's algorithms will have
           completely incorporated all of those early technologies.
           The focus and attentiveness of the AV will be such that
           would never have been attainable by a human, and we will
           be better off for it. We will bask in oblivious safety
           while our AV takes us to what we hope is our expected
           destination.
