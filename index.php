        <p>Automatic braking systems, a relatively new safety feature
           in some vehicles and a critical part of autonomous cars of 
           the future, are facing complaints from drivers who say
           some are activating for no apparent reason.

           the design of their autonomous and semiautonomous systems so it

        <p> One key challenge will be human driver reengagement. To experience
            most of the benefits of the technology, human drivers will need
            to be able to engage in other tasks while the vehicle is
            autonomously driving. For safety, however, they will need to 
            quickly reengage at the request of the vehicle. Such context 
            switching may need to occur fully and in a matter of seconds 
            or less. Cognitive science research on distracted driving suggests
            this may be a significant safety challenge.

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>It is no longer speculative fiction, it seems certain that transit 
           will be fully autonomous within the near future. The transition
           between the techonolgy we have now, and that certain future
           presents a challenge. 
        </p>
        <p>
           For humans, lack of an overriding algorithm that forces our hands
           with strict protocol means that we need to be always taking
           inventory of preventative and defensive actions while driving.
           This has traditionally been the sole responsibility of the driver,
           the captain of the vehicle. Now there are opportunities for
           the ball to be dropped, the responsibility to be muddied. 
        </p>
        <p>As the various parts of these technologies are 
           developed and implemented at different stages, we 
           still need to know how to safely and defensively pilot our
           own vehicles. The challenge will be to adapt to changing and
           unexpected human 
           behavior due to the effect of these new technologies, and adapt to 
           unexpected behaviors of a computer algorithm or failing sensors.

            This driver thinks their car has "Pedestrian Detection" 
            functionality.

            Turns out it doesn't.

        <p>
            It also turns out that even if it did, in this case, it
            wouldn't have prevented the pedestrians from getting hit.

      <p>Like much of technology, descriptions and summaries often end up in
         a kind of acronym soup, and this is no different when it comes to
         the sensors and various assisted driver technologies involved with
