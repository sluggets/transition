        <h3>Stage 1: Humans Need Help With This One</h3>
        <p>
           One does not have to travel far in a car to notice that
           proper following distance is something that humans really
           need help with. Googling <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&authuser=0&q=car+pileup&oq=car+pileup&gs_l=news">"car pile up"</a> shows what might be the result of poor following distance.
        </p>
        <p>
           I remember in my driver's education class, 
           the teacher had a braking reaction time simulator.
           We all took turns testing our reaction time. It was a fun
           game, but about as useful as those punching bag arcade games
           that test how powerful your punch is. Guiding a vehicle
           weighing 4,000 lbs or more around town is not a game, although
           it seems many if not most vehicles consider it to be so given
           the tightly-bound car packs you will see traveling around town or 
           on the highways. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Braking reaction time is not the only
           consideration when it comes to calculating following distance.
           Although, even that calculation is often incorrect because of
           drivers failing to take into consideration poor road
           conditions. However confident a driver is that he can stop
           in enough time given a small following distance, that does
           not dispense with the need for generous following distances.
           The smaller the following distance, the more closely the
           driver has to scrutinize the actions of the vehicle directly
           in front, to the point of focusing exclusively on the red
           brake lights on the vehicle ahead. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Even if not a flagrantly
           aggressive tailgater, poor following distance <em>does</em>
           have the effect of reducing your ability to monitor the
           situation ahead of or around you. 
           The closer you are to the vehicle ahead of you, the more of 
           that vehicle is blocking your view over and around it. This
           effect is even more pronounced when behind a tall or wide
           vehicle such as a bus or truck.
           You may be thinking, "Oh,
           I have snow tires, all-wheel drive, and a Northerner's knack
           for handling winter roads...", and then <a href="https://youtu.be/pmUue_krVDY?t=4m44s">--this happens--.</a>

        <h3>Stage 2: Help Arrives</h3>
        <p>
           Technologies such as ACC(Adaptive Cruise Control) and
           FCW(Forward Collision Warning) while potentially introducing
           unexpected behaviors as suggested in the "Distraction" segment
           , promise to reinforce our following distance discipline.
           Warnings and/or subtle braking will activate if our following
           distance shrinks to unsafe margins. Drivers may be presented
           with choices as to exactly how much following distance they
           want. However, ACC doesn't know what the road conditions are. 
           While allowing that choice may just result in 
           the driver always selecting the shortest following distance, 
           that is still likely better than the following distance
           that would otherwise be used. In 
           addition, if only one extremely generous following distance
           was offered, it might dramatically reduce the use
           of the safety feature. The driver may simply choose to turn
           it off. 
        </p>
        <p>
           An interesting discussion by drivers fitting ACC into their
           driving habits and following distance considerations is 
           here:  <cite><a href="http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/showthread.php/49732-Drivers-who-can-t-discern-between-safe-following-distance-and-going-slowly">"Drivers who can't discern between safe following distance and going slowly"-Tesla Motor Club Forums</a></cite>

        <h3>Stage 3: Less Following Distance?</h3>
        <p>Take all the factors that go into following distance: road
           conditions, braking reaction time, and ability to monitor
           important things <em>other</em> than the car in front us.
           Looking at truly autonomous vehicles we may see the 
           following distance actually shrink between vehicles.
           An AV could have a faster braking reaction time than
           a human. 
        </p>
        <p>
           The AV also would not have to worry about concentrating
           focus on the car directly in front for a couple reasons.
           Firstly, it will likely have LIDAR and/or other sensors
           mounted at such a height, that even with a minimal following
           distance it will still be able to see around and above the
           vehicle in front. The AV will be perfectly capable of splitting
           its attention between many inputs.
           Secondly, AVs could utilize V2V(Vehicle to Vehicle) communication 
           to share it's traveling speed, braking, or other information
           with vehicles around them, updating it in matters of milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
           Road conditions and weather could be propagated through V2V as
           well as through V2I(Vehicle to Infrastructure) communication.
