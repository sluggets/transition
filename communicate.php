        <h3>Stage 1: We Don't Have Antennas</h3>
        <p>
           Responsible communication not only includes
           properly using the lights and signals of our vehicles, but
           utilizing eye contact, hand signals, and visibility techniques
           for low profile motorcycles, mopeds, and bicycles. The horn
           is probably the most misused communication device in our
           current vehicles. Often it is an after-the-fact, long,
           punitive honk; an expression of road rage. It is more
           valuable as a preventative tool. Covering the horn with
           our hand, and using short attention-grabbing honks when
           you really think someone <em>needs</em> to see you is a
           polite and valid way to say "Hey, look at me, I'm right
           here!". Never assume that someone sees you.

        <h3>Stage 2: Not Quite There</h3>
        <p>
           Lane departure warnings (LDW) will potentially enhance our 
           "Communicate" defensive key. Changing lanes without using
           a turn signal would activate this technology to either give
           the driver some kind of warning signal, or even activate
           some corrective steering. More people communicating with 
           turn signals is a good thing. Although there is a possibility
           of drivers growing used to and ignoring such warnings, or
           simply turning off those features. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Adaptive headlights are another helpful feature that will help
           us communicate our presence without blinding oncoming traffic 
           by angling the beam to aim high or low.

           Different sensors have different capabilities. Some see certain
           materials better than others, and some have much shorter ranges
           than others. The ability for AVs to see low-profile vehicles
           and pedestrians on the roadway depends on just the right sensor
           suite and the learning process of gradually increasing sizes
           of datasets containing sensor patterns that the AV knows to 
           associate with them.

        <p>
           Figuring out the best way to communicate 
           your presence to an AV as a cyclist, motorcyclist, or pedestrian 
           will not necessarily be the same way that we communicate these
           things to a human eye. Our whole driving world is based upon the
           concept of humans communicating with other humans using gestures
           (whether they be polite or not), eye contact, acceleration,
           deceleration, and steering maneuvers. These communications indicate
           to other humans that <em>this</em> driver may be about engage in
           <em>that</em> kind of action. Many of these same cues may be 
           <em>far</em> less informative to an AV.

        <h3>Stage 3: Legacy Vehicles</h3>
        <p>
           From Microsoft operating systems to video game consoles, the
           march of technology has introduced "legacy software" or 
           "legacy systems". Backwards compatibility with software or
           hardware is sometimes maintained at the cost of progress. 
        </p>
        <p>
           The distant AV utopia offers a sophisticated communications
           solution (of unknown security) that may no longer even need
           turn signals <em>or</em> brake lights, if it wasn't for the
           need to be backwards-compatible with those pesky vehicles
           with the meat-based operating systems. "Grandfathered-in"
           vehicles will still require AVs to offer traditional lighting
           systems to communicate with legacy vehicles 
           despite promising concepts of wireless communication
           between AVs(V2V technology) and between vehicles and the 
           surrounding infrastructure (V2I technology).
        </p>
        <p>
           Possibly even more importantly, those new AVs will need to 
           maintain their backwards-compatibility in recognizing
           and properly interpreting the old-fashioned blinking lights
           of the legacy vehicles in inclement weather or blinding
           direct sunlight.
