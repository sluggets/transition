        <h3>Stage 1: No Zombies!!</h3>
        <p>
           Fatigue, impairment, or even a wandering mind as a result of
           boredom can render us into zombie mode. We can all agree that
           a typical shuffle-and-moan zombie would make a horrible driver.
           What helps me to avoid this syndrome is to actively go over
           defensive driving techniques in my mind when I find my
           thoughts straying too deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
           We should always keep looking, not letting our focus settle in
           any one place for more than two seconds. Intersections are the
           single location that have the most accidents, so it is 
           especially important to keep looking here. Scanning before 
           entering an intersection left, right, and then left again is
           crucial, whether from a stopped start or as we roll toward
           one.
        </p>
        <p>
           Green does not mean go! Green lights mean left-right-left,
           scan the intersection, <em>then</em> proceed. Even  Google's
           self-driving cars will pause when the light turns green and 
           scan before proceeding, and those cars have sophisticated
           roof-mounted laser scanning capabilities!

        <h3>Stage 2: Don't Take The Robot's Word For It!</h3>
        <p>
           In those instances where assisted driving technologies
           are looking around for us, we still need to follow that
           up with our own assessment.  
           We should treat those sensors as reassurance
           of our decisions rather than a substitution for our
           own decision-making. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Blind Spot Assist systems will monitor if there is a vehicle
           in the lane next to you and display an indicator if so.
           If the driver indicates a turn, it will increase the
           visibility of that warning, possibly including an alarm
           and braking actions. We still need to do our 
           over-the-shoulder check to manually see that it is clear
           to make a lane change. The habit is not worth breaking.
           The system may malfunction or fail, and we also may
           need to drive a vehicle without that system at some point.

             By hitting a turn-signal stalk, a driver theoretically
             acknowledges road conditions are appropriate for a 
             passing maneuver and therefore takes responsibility for
             the consequences.

           Backing Assist may consist of a camera in addition to sonar.
           Image quality can vary greatly, as can the actual condition
           of the lens surface of the camera(dirt, moisture). 
           A bike rack on the rear
           of the vehicle may trigger an alarm even though you know it
           is just the bike rack...or is it really just the bike rack? 
           Drivers must resist the
           focus stealing effect of having an in-dash monitor to gaze
           at. That image is only showing you a very small portion of
           what you need to be aware of. It is true, you now are seeing 
           something you otherwise would have been blind to, but it
           shouldn't be at the expense of the rear and side view mirrors
           <em>or</em> your over-the-shoulder check.
        </p>
        <p>
           ACC(Adaptive Cruise Control) and FCW(Forward Collision Warning)
           are also two assisted systems that could lull the driver into
           a false sense of security. 
           The potential exists for normally vigilant
           awareness of what is coming up ahead on the road to be relaxed.
           To truly "Keep Looking", shoulder checks, mirror checks, and 
           intersection scanning have to include looking into the future!
           One of the more challenging defensive techniques for me
           personally is lifting my eyesight up and consistently looking
           ahead at least a minimum of fifteen seconds into the future of
           where I am going to be. Granted, ACC and FCW are
           <em>assisting</em> with this, but we are personally responsible
           for ensuring that we have this critical information.

        <h3>Stage 3: All-Seeing and All-Knowing</h3>
        <p>
           When automakers actually begin marketing and selling a
           truly 100% autonomous self-driving vehicle, we will know
           that the redundancies, calibrations, and fail-safes have
           been worked out. The liability of not having these systems
           relatively hardened would prevent them from putting the
           autonomous stamp of approval on it. AVs will be able to
           "Keep Looking" in ways we humans will never be able to.
           They will be bristling with infrared, SONAR, LIDAR, RADAR,
           and other sensors in varying combinations at key vantage 
           points on the vehicle. Instead of shifting focus like we 
           humans have to, these inputs will be simultaneously processed by
           powerful CPUs drawing on vast databases of stored data.
