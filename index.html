            <p>Automatic braking systems, a relatively new safety feature
         in some vehicles and a critical part of autonomous cars of 
         the future, are facing complaints from drivers who say
         some are activating for no apparent reason.</p>

            <p>He added that automakers would have to spend years fine-tuning
         the design of their autonomous and semiautonomous systems so it
         became clear to drivers what the capabilities and shortcomings
         of the technologies were and to push drivers away from risky
         behavior.<p>

          <p>It is no longer speculative fiction, it seems certain that transit 
           will be fully autonomous within the near future. The transition
           between the techonolgy we have now, and that certain future, is the
           focus here.</p>
          <p>As the various parts of these technologies are 
           developed and implemented at different stages, we need to realize
           that we still need to know how to safely and defensively pilot our
           own vehicles. The challenge will be to adapt to changing human 
           behavior due to the effect of these new technologies, and adapt to 
           unexpected behavior of a computer or algorithm.</p>
