        <h3>Stage 1: The Driver is Mission Critical</h3>
        <p>
           Being in an altered state is being in any condition
           that reasonably detracts from your ability to safely
           operate a moving vehicle. In some instances, like
           alcohol there are
           well defined metrics as to exactly what that means.
           In the U.S, that is 0.08% blood alcohol content
           or greater, or 0.04% for those holding a commercial
           drivers license. In Colorado, that is more than 5
           nanograms of THC(psychoactive ingredient in marijuana)
           in the bloodstream.
        </p>
        <p>
           At a more basic level, <em>any</em> amount of <em>any</em> 
           substance(over-the-counter, prescription, illegal, or 
           legal) that impairs your ability to drive can bring
           civil or criminal penalties.
        </p>
        <p>
           You can find yourself in an altered state even without
           being under the influence of an external substance.
           Sleep deprivation is often compared to 
           alcohol intoxication. How many of us who could honestly
           and adamantly assert that we have <strong>never</strong>
           slipped in and out of consciousness from being drunk
           behind the wheel can also claim that we have never nodded
           off due to pushing our limits of alertness? There is no
           blood, breath, or urine test that will betray how much sleep
           we've gotten in the past 24 hours. And most of us aren't
           required to maintain log books on the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
           Emotional states such as anger or sadness can also impair 
           your ability to drive as can medical conditions, whether 
           they be the flu or the common cold.

        <h3>Stage 2: Do Robots Have Altered States?</h3> 
        <p>
           With assisted driving technologies, we still have primary
           control of the vehicle, so we cannot be impaired. However
           good of a job the autonomous features seem to be doing,
           the vehicle could be impaired as well. Any one sensor
           or systems relating to these sensors could be impaired.
           What is the fail-safe for when this happens? You the 
           human are. Whatever job the assisted technologies fail
           at, the human takes over for. Heavy rain, deep canyons,
           blizzards, hail, mud, direct sunlight or any number of 
           conditions could render all or part of these systems
           impaired.  
        </p>
        <p>
           Vehicle communication used to be relegated to blinking
           lights and arm or hand signals. AM/FM radios introduced
           another means for communication. In the 1980s, car phones
           were actually a thing people used. At this point the car
           itself was not yet responsible for acting on incoming
           communication. Then comes GPS, mobile broadband,
           and the multiple sensors
           utilized in assisted driving. Every new avenue of input
           brings with it not just opportunity for failure, but 
           also potential for security compromises. Add in the 
           DSRC(Dedicated Short-Range Communication) for V2V and
           V2I, and there are even more vectors for malicious attack.
           Zero-day security exploits may present an altered state
           for the vehicle that cannot be planned for.
        </p>
        <p>
           Also of concern are false positives that may startle
           drivers and eventually result in the system being 
           turned off or ignored. Redundant sensors and systems
           will over time increase their reliability and reduce false
           alerts and failures. For now we are still the ultimate
           redundant system, and we cannot be in an altered state!
        </p>
        <h3>Stage 3: Graceful Failure</h3>
        <p>
           One of the benefits promised by autonomous vehicles is the 
           ability for mentally or physically disabled individuals 
           to experience the freedom that having access to a personal
           vehicle allows. Imagine a blind person being able to get in
           a car and go anywhere! For this to happen the graceful failure
           of any or all of the systems will have to include a method 
           or means of self-guidance to a safe stop in a safe location.
        </p>
        <p>
           One <em>might</em> think that these failure modes will allow
           any number of altered states as well. Teetering out of a bar
           and tipping over into our AV is not something we will be 
           able to do anytime soon though. Disabled individuals and hardcore
           partiers may have a long time to wait for this feature even 
           though sufficiently robust technology for exactly this sort of 
           capability may come much faster than anyone thinks.
        </p>
        <p>
           The reason for this has to do with liability. Liability is 
           going to lengthen this transitionary period greatly. Currently,
           if there is a manufacturing defect or unsafe design that results 
           in injury or loss of life, car or parts manufacturers are often
           found liable. However if a driver decides to drive through a
           red light into a busy intersection, that obviously is the 
           responsibility of the driver. 
        </p>
        <p>
           In the case of a fully autonomous vehicle, if the
           design or implementation of the autonomous features causes
           the vehicle to pilot itself through a red light into a busy
           intersection, the manufacturer now has a new liability. That is,
           unless the manufacturer stipulates that the systems are still
           secondary to the ultimate responsibility of the driver. 
           In this case full autonomy doesn't exist and the driver
           still can't be prohibitively disabled or unsafely impaired.
